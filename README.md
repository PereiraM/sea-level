sea-level
=========

Visualization of projected regional variation in future rise in sea level under two scenarios for greenhouse gas emissions. 

Simple animation of images using JQuery/JQuery UI. Maps drawn from NetCDF (http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) files using Panoply (http://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/). 

Data from Mah√© Perrette of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, from simulations using methods described in this paper (http://www.earth-syst-dynam.net/4/11/2013/esd-4-11-2013.html), updated to account for new estimates of the contributions to sea level rise made by melting Greenland (http://www.the-cryosphere-discuss.net/6/3101/2012/tcd-6-3101-2012.html) and Antarctic (http://www.the-cryosphere-discuss.net/6/3447/2012/tcd-6-3447-2012.html) ice.
